# csci4511w_final_project

**Project Outline:**

1. **Environments:**  
   - Test on 2D and 3D grid worlds of varying sizes and obstacle densities.

2. **Algorithms:**  
   - **Uninformed:** IDDFS, BFS, DFS  
   - **Informed:** A* (with Manhattan heuristic), Greedy Best-First, Uniform-Cost

3. **Metrics:**  
   - **Test Time:** Average runtime to find a solution or determine no solution exists.  
   - **Accuracy:** Percentage of trials that yield the shortest correct path.  
   - **Path Optimality:** Measure the path cost relative to the known shortest path (Optimality Ratio and Excess Steps).  
   - **Resource Utilization:** Memory usage (peak and average), number of node expansions.  
   - **Robustness and Reliability:** Success rate in finding any valid path, frequency of failure modes.  
   - **Scalability Indicators:** Observe how performance and memory scale with increasing grid sizes and complexity, and how performance changes with varying obstacle distributions.  
   - **Consistency:** Variability in runtime and accuracy (e.g., standard deviations).
